[ML-SII] Steam Games Recommendation System

This repository stores a Machine Learning and Intelligent Internet Systems project made by Romeo Reiner and Romualdi Gabriele for the test.

The purpose of the project was the creation of a Steam game Recommender system through standard Machine Learning approaches and classifiers, such as Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Stochastic Gradient Descent for the sentiment analysis part, while the recommender part is being done with an hybrid-approach recommender system.

The process is implemented in Python and its libraries.

The output of the computations was then visualized through plots, WordCloud and the recommendations given to the users.

Steps:

- Data gathering
- Data cleaning
- Text stemming
- Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes , Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Decisions Tree classifiers training on the train and test sets built
- WordCloud and Plots representation of data
- Game ranking system based on their reviews
- Recommending video-games to the user based on their gaming behaviour

An exhaustive review of the whole process is stored within the PDF file.
